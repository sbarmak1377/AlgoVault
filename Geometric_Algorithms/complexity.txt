1. 2D Rotation & Scale Matrices
Time Complexity: O(1) per point or O(n) for multiplying two 2×2 matrices with the naive algorithm (constant here).
Space Complexity: O(1)

2. 2D Rotation & Translation Matrices (homogeneous 3×3)
Time Complexity: O(1) per point, O(1) per composition; naive 3×3 multiply is O(1) (constant).
Space Complexity: O(1)

3. 2D Changing Coordinate Systems
Time Complexity: O(1) to build matrix; applying to a vector is O(1).
Space Complexity: O(1)

4. 3D Rotation & Scale Matrices
Time Complexity: O(1) per point; composing 3×3 matrices is O(1) (constant for fixed size).
Space Complexity: O(1)

5. 3D Changing Coordinate Systems
Time Complexity: O(1) to build matrix; applying to a vector is O(1).
Space Complexity: O(1)
