Push Time Complexity: O(n)
Pop Time Complexity: O(n)
Note: In a linked list implementation, if you donâ€™t maintain a tail pointer
(which points to the last element, as in my implementation), the complexity will be O(n).
Suggestion: If you hold your last pushed data at the beginning of the linkedlist, you can get O(1) for push and pop.
