1. Disjoint Sets (Union–Find with path compression + union by rank)
Time Complexity: Amortized ~O(α(n)) per operation (α is the inverse Ackermann function)
Space Complexity: O(n)

2. Huffman Coding (prefix code)
Time Complexity: O(k log k) to build the tree, where k is the number of distinct symbols;
                 Encoding O(L) and Decoding O(L) where L is number of bits processed
Space Complexity: O(k) for the tree and code table
