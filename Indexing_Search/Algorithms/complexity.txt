1. Linear Search
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1) -> no new space required by algorithm

2. Binary Search -> works only for sorted lists(it's good practice to keep some sort of order in your data if it doesn't have too much cost)
Time Complexity: O(log(n))
Space Complexity: O(1) -> no new space required by algorithm
Note: If implemented recursively, Space complexity will increase to O(log(n))
