1. Fibonacci — DP (bottom-up)
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

2. Making Change (Unbounded Coin Change — min coins)
Time Complexity: O(A * C)  where A=amount, C=number of coin types
Space Complexity: O(A)

3. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
Time Complexity: O(n * m)
Space Complexity: O(n * m)   # with full table reconstruction
